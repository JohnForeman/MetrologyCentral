      <h2>John Foreman</h2>
      <p class="title">Metrologist & Quality Systems Engineer</p>
      <p>I began my journey in metrology in 1990 as a CMM operator after completing a five-year apprenticeship as a toolmaker. Leveraging a strong foundation in computer programming, I quickly advanced into CMM programming—at a time when very few people had experience in it.</p>

      <p>During my career I’ve mastered multiple CMM programming environments, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DMIS with CAMIO and MODUS</li>
        <li>DEA Spectrum (BASIC and FORTRAN)</li>
        <li>Nikon/LK Metrology Focus software</li>
        <li>PolyWorks (lasers and probing)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My software background (VB.NET, C#, Python) has enabled me to build custom quality systems applications throughout my career—from a full quality process tracking system for Chrysler, to one of the earliest REVO system integration tools for CATIA.</p>

      <p>I’m passionate about dimensional metrology because it demands constant learning, creativity, and problem-solving. Working in digital design verification and modern quality systems gives me the opportunity to both teach and continue learning every day.</p>

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>Although I don’t hold formal academic degrees, my career has been built on rigorous hands-on learning—what I jokingly refer to as earning a Master’s and Ph.D. from the “school of hard knocks.”</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Specialized GD&T training</li>
    <li>Management education through Chrysler</li>
    <li>Various metrology and quality seminars</li>
  </ul>
